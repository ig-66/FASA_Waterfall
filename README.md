## Requirements

Simply drag and drop FASA_Waterfall into the GameData folder.

## Progress
Bellow is a table with the FASA engine and the Stock engine analog for said engine:

OBS: Some Stock engines were modelled after real world engines, but some do not have a perfect match for a real world engine, for those whose in-game analog is not obvious, for those, the template engine was choosen according to their visual similarity.
